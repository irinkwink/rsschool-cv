### Summary

I went into programming 18 years ago at the institute. It was Pascal and Delphi. And we use floppy disks. It was *painful*. Therefore I was fascinated by design and I went to study as an interior designer. I worked as a graphic designer and designer at a furniture factory. Design is a very subjective profession. You do not know how to determine that everything is done correctly and works. 

In programming I am confident in the result. The goal is to create a working product. And I know what's inside it. Design skills allow me to write beautiful code and develop useful and convenient apps for people.

For four years I did not approach the laptop and worked as a mountain guide on Elbrus. It's an interesting job, but I missed the feeling of learning something new. Now I'm ready to dive into **front-end development** and learn how to create magic with the help of letters and numbers (&special symbols).
